Daily practice repository for Python, SQL, and JavaScript.
Goal: build strong fundamentals and consistency through small daily commits.

## Why this repo
- I want to demonstrate consistent coding practice (even as a non-CS background).
- Focus on fundamentals that directly support data science, analytics, and product development.

## Repository structure
- `01_python/` : Python basics (day-by-day practice)
- `02_sql/` : SQL fundamentals + analytics queries
- `03_javascript/` : JavaScript basics for web/UI and simple data visualization

## Daily routine (rule)
- Minimum: 1 meaningful commit/day
- A “meaningful commit” can be:
  - 10+ lines of code, or
  - small refactor + comments, or
  - short documentation update (README/notes) when needed

## Progress log
- Day 1: Variables & data types (Python)

## Notes
- This repo is for learning and demonstrations. No private keys or sensitive data is committed.
